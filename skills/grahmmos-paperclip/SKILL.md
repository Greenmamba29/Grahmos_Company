## Cursor Cloud Adapter Setup (Osiris Hermes)

The CEO agent uses the Cursor Cloud adapter which runs in Cursor's hosted cloud infrastructure.

### Required Configuration
- Adapter type: Cursor Cloud
- Repository URL: https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company
- Starting ref: main
- Cursor runtime: Cursor hosted
- CURSOR_API_KEY: Set in environment variables

### Environment Variables Required
- CURSOR_API_KEY: Cursor background agent API key (crsr_...)
- GH_TOKEN: GitHub fine-grained PAT (github_pat_...) with all-repos access

### Critical Setup Requirement
The Cursor Cloud adapter uses Cursor's GitHub App (NOT the GH_TOKEN) to clone repos.
You MUST connect your GitHub account to Cursor in:
Cursor app -> Settings -> Integrations -> GitHub

Without this OAuth connection, you will see:
  [validation_error] Failed to verify existence of branch 'main' in repository

### Managed Instructions Bundle
The agent instructions are stored as a Paperclip managed bundle at:
  /paperclip/instances/default/companies/{company-id}/agents/{agent-id}/instructions/AGENTS.md

The AGENTS.md in the GitHub repo root is a SEPARATE file used by the Cursor Cloud
adapter's coding context. Both must exist:
1. GitHub repo: AGENTS.md (root of repo) - for Cursor Cloud coding context
2. Paperclip managed bundle: AGENTS.md - for heartbeat instructions injection

## GitHub Repo Structure

```
Grahmos_Company/
  AGENTS.md          # CEO agent instructions (Cursor coding context)
  README.md          # Repository readme
  LICENSE            # MIT License
  .gitignore         # Git ignore

      SKILL.md       # This file - company setup documentation
```

## Security operations baseline

The repo now includes a dedicated security operations pack under `docs/security`
covering:

- API key rotation requirements for Cursor, GitHub, Paperclip, and related
  operator-managed credentials
- Docker hardening expectations for VPS-hosted workloads
- a dated secrets-management audit capturing current gaps and follow-up actions

This gives future heartbeats a durable source of truth even when the private
Paperclip board cannot be mutated from the current runtime.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: "Failed to determine repository default branch"
**Cause:** Starting ref field was empty, forcing auto-detection
**Fix:** Set Starting ref = main in Cursor Cloud adapter config

### Error: "Failed to verify existence of branch 'main'"
**Cause:** Cursor GitHub App not authorized for this GitHub account
**Fix:** In Cursor app -> Settings -> Integrations -> connect GitHub account

### Error: "could not read agent instructions file .../AGENTS.md: ENOENT"
**Cause:** Paperclip managed instructions bundle not initialized
**Fix:** Go to Paperclip -> Osiris Hermes -> Instructions -> click AGENTS.md -> add content -> Save

### Error: "cursor_cloud requires repoUrl in adapterC..."
**Cause:** Repository URL field is empty in Cursor Cloud config
**Fix:** Set Repository URL = https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company

### Error: "Failed to start command hermes in ."
**Cause:** Hermes Agent (local) workspace not initialized
**Fix:** This adapter requires the hermes binary in PATH and a valid working directory.
  Check that the Paperclip Docker container has hermes installed and the project workspace exists.

## Heartbeat Schedule
- Heartbeat on interval: ON
- Interval: every 300 seconds (5 minutes)

## Company Mission
Becoming the Apple of AI infrastructure.
