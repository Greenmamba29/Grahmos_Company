## Cursor Cloud Adapter Setup (Osiris Hermes)

The CEO agent uses the Cursor Cloud adapter which runs in Cursor's hosted cloud infrastructure.

### Required Configuration
- Adapter type: Cursor Cloud
- Repository URL: https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company
- Starting ref: main
- Cursor runtime: Cursor hosted
- CURSOR_API_KEY: Set in environment variables

### Environment Variables Required
- CURSOR_API_KEY: Cursor background agent API key (crsr_...)
- GH_TOKEN: GitHub fine-grained PAT (github_pat_...) with all-repos access

### Critical Setup Requirement
The Cursor Cloud adapter uses Cursor's GitHub App (NOT the GH_TOKEN) to clone repos.
You MUST connect your GitHub account to Cursor in:
Cursor app -> Settings -> Integrations -> GitHub

Without this OAuth connection, you will see:
  [validation_error] Failed to verify existence of branch 'main' in repository

### Repo Scope Guardrail
Osiris Hermes is intentionally wired to the company repo:
  https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company

That repo is for company operations, instructions, and Paperclip setup. It is not a
product monorepo. If a wake payload references product packages, apps, or workspaces
that are not present in this checkout (for example `@grahmos/platform`), treat that as
a source-repo routing problem first, not an implementation failure in this repository.

### Managed Instructions Bundle
The agent instructions are stored as a Paperclip managed bundle at:
  /paperclip/instances/default/companies/{company-id}/agents/{agent-id}/instructions/AGENTS.md

The AGENTS.md in the GitHub repo root is a SEPARATE file used by the Cursor Cloud
adapter's coding context. Both must exist:
1. GitHub repo: AGENTS.md (root of repo) - for Cursor Cloud coding context
2. Paperclip managed bundle: AGENTS.md - for heartbeat instructions injection

## GitHub Repo Structure

```

  AGENTS.md          # CEO agent instructions (Cursor coding context)
  README.md          # Repository readme
  LICENSE            # MIT License

```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: "Failed to determine repository default branch"
**Cause:** Starting ref field was empty, forcing auto-detection
**Fix:** Set Starting ref = main in Cursor Cloud adapter config

### Error: "Failed to verify existence of branch 'main'"
**Cause:** Cursor GitHub App not authorized for this GitHub account
**Fix:** In Cursor app -> Settings -> Integrations -> connect GitHub account

### Error: "could not read agent instructions file .../AGENTS.md: ENOENT"
**Cause:** Paperclip managed instructions bundle not initialized
**Fix:** Go to Paperclip -> Osiris Hermes -> Instructions -> click AGENTS.md -> add content -> Save

### Error: "cursor_cloud requires repoUrl in adapterC..."
**Cause:** Repository URL field is empty in Cursor Cloud config
**Fix:** Set Repository URL = https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company

### Error: "Failed to start command hermes in ."
**Cause:** Hermes Agent (local) workspace not initialized
**Fix:** This adapter requires the hermes binary in PATH and a valid working directory.
  Check that the Paperclip Docker container has hermes installed and the project workspace exists.

### Recovery: issue references code that is not in this repo
**Signal:** The issue mentions packages, apps, or workspace names that do not exist in
this checkout (for example `@grahmos/platform`, design-system packages, product UI code,
or monorepo tooling such as pnpm workspaces or Turborepo config).

**Cause:** The Cursor Cloud adapter is pointed at `Grahmos_Company`, but the issue
belongs to a different source repository.

**Action:**
1. Confirm the target repo URL and the owning agent/team for that codebase.
2. Leave a durable note describing the mismatch and the exact repo/action needed.
3. Keep the issue blocked until the adapter or assignee is redirected to the correct repo.
4. Do not fabricate implementation work in `Grahmos_Company` for code that lives elsewhere.
