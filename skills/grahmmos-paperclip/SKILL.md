## Cursor Cloud Adapter Setup (Osiris Hermes)

The CEO agent uses the Cursor Cloud adapter which runs in Cursor's hosted cloud infrastructure.

### Required Configuration
- Adapter type: Cursor Cloud
- Repository URL: https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company
- Starting ref: main
- Cursor runtime: Cursor hosted
- CURSOR_API_KEY: Set in environment variables

### Environment Variables Required
- CURSOR_API_KEY: Cursor background agent API key (crsr_...)
- GH_TOKEN: GitHub fine-grained PAT (github_pat_...) with all-repos access

### Critical Setup Requirement
The Cursor Cloud adapter uses Cursor's GitHub App (NOT the GH_TOKEN) to clone repos.
You MUST connect your GitHub account to Cursor in:
Cursor app -> Settings -> Integrations -> GitHub

Without this OAuth connection, you will see:
  [validation_error] Failed to verify existence of branch 'main' in repository

### Managed Instructions Bundle
The agent instructions are stored as a Paperclip managed bundle at:
  /paperclip/instances/default/companies/{company-id}/agents/{agent-id}/instructions/AGENTS.md

The AGENTS.md in the GitHub repo root is a SEPARATE file used by the Cursor Cloud
adapter's coding context. Both must exist:
1. GitHub repo: AGENTS.md (root of repo) - for Cursor Cloud coding context
2. Paperclip managed bundle: AGENTS.md - for heartbeat instructions injection

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: "Failed to determine repository default branch"
**Cause:** Starting ref field was empty, forcing auto-detection
**Fix:** Set Starting ref = main in Cursor Cloud adapter config

### Error: "Failed to verify existence of branch 'main'"
**Cause:** Cursor GitHub App not authorized for this GitHub account
**Fix:** In Cursor app -> Settings -> Integrations -> connect GitHub account

### Error: "could not read agent instructions file .../AGENTS.md: ENOENT"
**Cause:** Paperclip managed instructions bundle not initialized
**Fix:** Go to Paperclip -> Osiris Hermes -> Instructions -> click AGENTS.md -> add content -> Save

### Error: "cursor_cloud requires repoUrl in adapterC..."
**Cause:** Repository URL field is empty in Cursor Cloud config
**Fix:** Set Repository URL = https://github.com/Greenmamba29/Grahmos_Company

### Error: "Failed to start command hermes in ."
**Cause:** Hermes Agent (local) workspace not initialized
**Fix:** This adapter requires the hermes binary in PATH and a valid working directory.
  Check that the Paperclip Docker container has hermes installed and the project workspace exists.

### Error: "`opencode models` timed out after 20s"
**Cause:** A local `opencode_local` adapter could not enumerate models quickly
enough on the host where the Paperclip agent is running. This usually points to a
host-side OpenCode problem rather than a repository-code problem: missing CLI
install, broken provider credentials, dead backend connectivity, or a hung
OpenCode runtime.
**Fix:** Diagnose the actual local adapter host, not Cursor Cloud. Verify that:
1. `opencode` is installed and callable on the Paperclip host
2. `opencode models` succeeds interactively on that host
3. model enumeration returns within Paperclip's timeout window

If `opencode models` hangs or times out, repair the host OpenCode installation,
credentials, or backend connection before rerunning the blocked heartbeat.
**Review note:** Cursor Cloud may not have the `opencode` CLI installed at all, so
absence of the command there does not reproduce the local adapter failure.

## Heartbeat Schedule
- Heartbeat on interval: ON
- Interval: every 300 seconds (5 minutes)

## Company Mission
Becoming the Apple of AI infrastructure.
